    Slow down. Give yourself the time you need.
    Coding is easy, when you figure it out.
    Its just a bunch of rules that you have to figure out along with all the various patterns that exists 
    within that language.

    We as humans are the best pattern recognisers. We deal with patterns and rules everyday.
    When we are dealing with another human, we are constantly trying to figure out the rules that they 
    work within and we negotiate the rules that the both of us can conclusively agree is beneficial to us
    and we do all of that without ever actually consciously setting up the rules. We do it automatically
    because we do that everyday. If we don't like the rules that somebody has, we tend to move away from that 
    person. Every person will subject themselves to their own rules first and everything else is secondary,
    a means of fitting in. So if your rule is to give up easily, you will do that. If your rule is that 
    everything can be made easy, you will also do that. So we need to figure out what rules will you be 
    willing to accept as an individual.
  
    Now coding is simple, because unlike a human being, a computer thinks in binary. A computer
    cannot conceive multiple scenarios at once, it only moves from one state to the other. The advantage
    it has over a human is it can do that very, very quickly. So we as humans can use that to our advantage,
    use a computer as a tool to solve boring, repetitive things or you can infinitely scroll through your 
    social media feeds.

    Programming can be made easy.

    The only thing that you have to understand, is... 
    WTF is the value of the varaible that you are using.
    If you can understand what value it holds, you will be able to do something 
    with that value.
    Programming is just that, doing something with a value i.e your data and telling the computer
    what you want it to do with that data. So don't overcomplicate things by only staring
    at various variable name without understanding what the value of that variable is.
    Always try to figure out the value of something, in life or in code.

    There is nothing to scary about programming. You learn a programming language so that 
    you can speak with the computer, so you'll have to understand the rules of a language.
    You can understand these sentences because you know the rules of the english language.
    A programming language is similar in that regards that you can communicate with the computer
    if you understand the rules of the language that you are using.

    But unlike a human who can have mulitple interpretations of the same sentence, a computer will only
    understand it one way (most of the times). So you want to be precise about what you tell your computer
    to do when you are programming. A computer is rarely at fault if it doesn't do what you tell it do. 
    Most of the times you will have written something vague because you are still trying to figure out all
    the rules that you need to get your code working. Don't worry, it takes time. Time is something you will
    have to invest into anything in life if you want to make that thing work. So give it time, relax, breathe in
    and start over. That's another great thing about programming, you can always start over, we can't say the same
    about life. So if you'd like to change your personal rule from "It's too difficult!!!", to, "I can make it better and I
    can make it easy" you are on the right path. 

    Things are never as complicated as they seem, simplify it.
    And don't give up. You'll get there, in time.
